## usage
```javascript
const unlru = require("unnecessarily-native-lru");

//create a cache that has upto 1024 slots
const cache = unlru.Factory({reserved: 1024});

cache.set("some/path/we/want/to/remember", {foo: "bar"});
cache.set("some-other/path/we/want/to/remember", {bar: "foo"});

let obj = cache.get("some/path/we/want/to/remember");
//obj = {foo: "bar"}
obj = null; 

let metadata = cache.meta("some/path/we/want/to/remember");
//Metadata { last: 1, birth: 0, hits: 1 }

metadata instanceof unlru.MetadataObject;
//true

let itdoesntexist = cache.meta("some/path/we/want/to/remember/but/not/in/cache");
//null

//frees it from the cache and removes references to that object. if no other variable references the
//object, it tells v8 that it is okay to remove it.
cache.evict("some/path/we/want/to/remember"); 

cache.get("some/path/we/want/to/remember");
//returns undefined

//this variation weakly evicts the entry, that is, it doesn't remove the entry in cache
//until the v8 GC removes it, and then the cache record is invalidated.
cache.evict("some-other/path/we/want/to/remember", true);

//as long as the GC didn't collect, the cache record is still accessible.
cache.get("some-other/path/we/want/to/remember"); 
//returns {bar: "foo"}

//and there is also
cache.clear();
//which removes its references to all of the underlying JS objects 
//(which if no other refences are held, the GC would eventually collect those objects), 
//and invalidates the whole cache.

```
